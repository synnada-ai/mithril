    """Performs binary search between lower and upper limits to find the interval
    of points whose images according to "eval_fn" are equal to "target". Since
    floating-point arithmetic has round-off errors, such points often form a
    non-singleton interval. This function finds the largest contigous interval of
    such solution points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    eval_fn : Callable[[float], float]
        The function whose solution interval is sought.
    target : float
        Target function value to solve for.
    max_it : int, optional
        Maximum allowed iteration count, by default 1000.
    lower : float, optional
        Lower boundary of the search interval, by default -1000.
    upper : float, optional
        Upper boundary of the search interval, by default 1001.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[float, float]
        Largest interval that is mapped to same function value (i.e. target).

    Parameters
    ----------

        The function to generate a guess point at every iteration.
